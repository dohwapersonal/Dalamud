# Dalamud Plugin API
This is the documentation for the publicly accessible Dalamud plugin API. See the [rich presence plugin](https://github.com/goaaats/Dalamud.RichPresence) as an example.

All plugins have to implement the [IDalamudPlugin interface](Dalamud.Plugin.IDalamudPlugin.yml) that gives them access to objects like the chat command manager and game client information.
